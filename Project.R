##The churn dataset contains data on a variety of telecom customers and the modeling challenge is to predict which customers will cancel their service.

#Make custom train/test indices

# Create custom indices: myFolds
myFolds <- createFolds(churn_y, k = 5)

# Create reusable trainControl object: myControl
myControl <- trainControl(
  summaryFunction = twoClassSummary,
  classProbs = TRUE, # IMPORTANT!
  verboseIter = TRUE,
  savePredictions = TRUE,
  index = myFolds
)
